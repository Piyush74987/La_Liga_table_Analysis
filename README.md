Imported and cleaned datasets using Python and Pandas, handling missing data, and ensuring data consistency across multiple seasons.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Performed EDA to identify patterns, outliers, and trends in the league standings, such as the impact of home vs. away games on team performance, and the correlation between goals scored and points earned.
### Advanced Analytics:
Applied techniques like rolling averages to analyze team form over time, and clustering to group teams based on similar performance metrics.
### Visualization with Power BI:
Created interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize league standings, team performance over time, head-to-head comparisons, and more. These visualizations were designed to be user-friendly and provide actionable insights at a glance.
#### Reporting and Insights:
Compiled the findings into a comprehensive report, offering insights into the factors that influence a team's success in the league, such as goal difference, defensive stability, and consistency in home and away matches.
This project showcases skills in data manipulation, statistical analysis, and the ability to translate complex data into clear, actionable insights through visualization.
